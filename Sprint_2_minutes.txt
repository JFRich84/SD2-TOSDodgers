Discussions from Meeting on 13 October 2023:

    Wireframe is a black and white schematic of our website showing all pages and the layout of the pages

    The modfiy/remove/add pages will all be separate pages and not inline popups for simplicity

    Flow chart is a diagram showing the path a user takes in an application to complete a task. 

    Upload the pdf from sprint 1 into our github repository

    George is away from 29 October to 5 November

    Have a version control with Overview file in repository (clarify with Justin on how to do this)
