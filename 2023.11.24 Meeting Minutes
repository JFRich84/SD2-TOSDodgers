Attendees: TT, JR, GS
Apologies: AH

Sprint 3 reqs:
- Updated task board of user stories showing progress in the technical deliverables.
Github repository showing work from all members of the team ie, regular commits from all team members.
Implementation progress towards final version of application:
Database design
Database implementation with pre-filled data
HTML pages generated from PUG templates, showing static content
At least some dynamic content being pulled from your database to your templates via Pug, 
ie the 'read only' features that were planned after sprint 2.

What we need to do:
- Upload PUG templates. Download, put in correct folder location and make sure
that git is pointing to it. We need to use the most recent published version from Moodle.
- Simple physical data model is complete. Changes updated based on testing of the sample data.
We need to make some adjustments to the sample data to reflect. 
- Dynamic code pulling from database to follow after the above steps are complete. 

- We will regroup on Sunday PM (26/11). 
- GS and RJ will upload PUG templates on Sunday to start the base planning. 
- Delegating AH to start with the dynamic content from database via pug.
